# MOONRAKER

An app to track the position of a Moon Buggy and Moon Rover

Set the size of the area to explore, set the starting position of each craft, and set the route for the mission

## Design and Functionality Assumptions

- Radio buttons used for input but labels have been removed to make app accessible and intuitively usable

- Radio buttons to set grid area and to set starting position are zero-indexed

- Single page stateful application passes data to pure utility function for mission output

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

To get the project up and running locally:

- Clone this repo and then run the command `npm install` from the root directory. This will install all the necessary dependencies

- Run the command `npm start` to start a server. This should automatically open MOONRAKER in your browser, but you can also navigate to the URL given in the console
